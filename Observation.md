The checkout function is doing too much because it handles both the payment logic and printing messages. If tomorrow you change how payments are processed or how the output is shown, you will have to edit the same function. Also, every time you add a new payment method, youâ€™ll need to update the enum, the switch block, and possibly the main function, which makes the code harder to extend. The Unknown option in the enum is not really needed since the default case already handles invalid inputs. Overall, the design ties everything together too tightly, so the code will become messy and difficult to maintain as more payment options are added.
